# Basic Stock Tracker

- Just a basic stock tracker, input the stocks you want to track into the data.txt file and run the file.
- Stocks will update once every 5 seconds, you can adjust this by changing the number to be faster or slower in the time.sleep() function.
- If you remove the time.sleep() function, the code will skip over stocks that did not change price (code will run marginally faster).
- More to be added at a later date.
